    "# Machine Learning Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "A Machine Learning pipeline is a set of independent steps that each can have different compute, data, environment, etc. dependencies. Each step is treated as a separate run and all of the four aspects of a run (metrics, logs, snapshot and outputs) are stored independently. After the pipeline is created, it can be published as an API for later reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives you huge benefit as you have ultimate control over defining each step of the pipeline in a way that serves best for that particular step.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML Pipelines are some type of workflow orchestration tools. The main difference between ML Pipelines and regular job workflows (such as Azure Data Factory or Airflow) is that this workflow engine is designed to address ML needs. Therefore, if you have non-ML related workflow it's recommended you use generic workflow engines. You may call an ML Pipeline from a generic pipeline as a step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we want to treat the MNIST model we trained in the previous example like a serious ML problem. We'd like to break the task into three parts:\n",
    "1. Downloading the dataset from the Yann Lecun website, unzip and normalize it and save it in a shared storage\n",
    "2. Train our 2-Layer Neural Net on the normalized data\n",
    "3. Register the model in case the performance of the new model is higher than the latest version of the model in the Model Registry\n",
    "4. Publish the pipeline as a bundle of the above steps as an API Endpoint"
